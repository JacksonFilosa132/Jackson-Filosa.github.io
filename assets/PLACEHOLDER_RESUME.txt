This is a placeholder file. To add your actual resume to the live site:

1) Replace or upload a PDF named `resume.pdf` into the `assets/` directory.
   - Path: `assets/resume.pdf`
2) The "Download Resume" button on the homepage will then link directly to it and the PDF will be embedded in the page when supported.

If you want me to upload your resume for you, attach the PDF here or tell me the file path and I'll place it in `assets/resume.pdf`.
