# GitHub Pages resume site

This repo contains a simple static site template for your resume, bio, LinkedIn link, and certifications.

How to customize

1. Edit `index.html`:
   - Replace the short bio and longer 'About' text.
   - Replace the placeholder LinkedIn URL with your LinkedIn profile URL.
2. Add your resume:
   - Upload a PDF named `assets/resume.pdf`.
3. Update certifications:
   - Edit the `<ul>` under the "Certifications" section in `index.html` to list and link each cert.

Publishing (GitHub Pages)

- Go to your repo Settings → Pages and set the source to the `main` branch and the `/ (root)` folder. Save.
- Wait a minute; your site will be available at `https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>`.

If you want the site at `https://yourusername.github.io`, the repository must be named exactly `yourusername.github.io`. If you'd like, I can prepare the steps to rename the repo for you or proceed after you confirm.
